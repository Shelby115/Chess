# Chess

The idea behind this project is to create a simple chess game and expand from there to turn it into a custom chess game with various features.
I'm sticking to the concrete game of chess and all of its rules first as a solid basis and will customize from there.

Plans:
1. Create and implement single player chess (ability to move pieces and win/lose when king is captured).
2. Create a simplistic AI to verse (i.e., AI will choose random "valid" moves).
3. (Maybe) Convert it into a multiplayer game of chess. This would probably involve a large chunk of restructuring so I'm going to leave it as a maybe.
4. Begin creating custom units with unique aspects.
5. Create custom game modes that have different win/lose objectives.
